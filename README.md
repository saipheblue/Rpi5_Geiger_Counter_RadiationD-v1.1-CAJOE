# Issues

If you got permisisons error then use **sudo**

If you get 404 error make sure index page is in "templates" folder, it is case sensitive
It should have following structure:
- Project
- - geiger.py
- - templates
- - - index.html

Documentation from manufacturer is listing M4011 which has teh same specs as J305

ssl_context=('cert.pem', 'key.pem') can be replaced by ssl_context='adhoc' if oyu dotn have keys - https://zhangtemplar.github.io/flask/

rpi5 has problems with gpio remove it using:
```
sudo apt remove python3-rpi.gpio
```
and install lgpio
```
python3 -m pip install rpi-lgpio flask
```
if you have problems with install use:
```
python3 -m pip install rpi-lgpio flask --break-system-packages
```
